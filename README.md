# Awesome Robot Social Navigation
This repo keeps track of the historical and recent advances in robot social navigation/crowd navigation/navigation in dynamic or human environments.

- **I'm actively developing this list, if you would like to contribute or spot any error, please open a pull request!**
- For viewers' convenience, the links of papers first prioritize their websites, and then the free preprints if they are publicly available.
