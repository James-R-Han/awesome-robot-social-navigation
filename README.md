# Awesome-robot-social-navigation
This repo keeps track of the recent advances in robot social navigation/crowd navigation/navigation in dynamic or human environments.

- **I'm actively developing this list, if you would like to contribute or spot any error, please open a pull request!**
- For viewers' convenience, the links of papers will first prioritize their websites, and then the free preprints if they are publicly available.
